<h2 id="fall-2023">Fall 2023</h2>

<p>Even though I had already done BrowserHistory 1,2, &amp; 3 before, I approached them as if I hadn’t because I had to refresh my memory. For HistoryBrowser3 (BH3), my first attempt was 12 minutes so I did it again to hit Rx. What I had done differently for BH3 was utilizing the LiveReload. It was a big help because I could see the changes happening simultaneously. It helped me to understand the HTML code used on another level such as distinguishing between paddings and margins. Previously, my solution was different than the screencast (I didn’t make the column width 300px and used the flex property). But ultimately, because the WOD instructed to have each column width 300px, I followed the screencast version</p>

<h2 id="fall-2022">Fall 2022</h2>

<p><em>If I could sum up my experience with the first three WODs in one word, it would be: CHALLENGING</em></p>

<p>Challenging because, honestly, it took me some time to get started on my WODs, but once I got it started, I wish I started a bit earlier because of how straightforward and simple it was. I thought it would be complicated to develop, but it was as simple as following the instructions.</p>

<p>For <strong>BrowserHistory1</strong>, I attempted it twice. My first attempt was around 23mins. After the first attempt, watching the solution has helped me improve on my speed to 13mins. What took me awhile on the first attempt was copying the sections of paragraphs one at a time. Instead, it was quicker to copy/paste the entire text at once (as shown in the screencast). Going back and forth copying and pasting was time-consuming. I also took time to clean up and align the html tags which were unneccesary.</p>

<p>Additionally, creating IDs for each section heading to link it in the Table of Contents section was something new for me such as typing “#” in front of the ID to locate a section on the same web page. Doing that exercise helped me to understand how important IDs were. It is crucial that I make sure I typed the IDs exactly the same (uppercase or lowercase).</p>

<p><strong>BrowserHistory2</strong> was not as time-consuming as the first. It focused more on the CSS stylesheet in which I had to change the font-family, font color, background color, margins, width, and styling the img inline with the text. I had a bit of trouble with styling the img and I typed down every margin property (top, bottom, left, right). I didn’t utilize the shorthand function with the margins (ex: margin: 10px, 50px, 10px, 50px). I also separated h1 and h2 which I could avoid by typing it next to each other (ex: h1, h2) My first attempt was 18mins and I bumped it to 7mins after watching the screencast.</p>

<p><strong>BrowserHistory3</strong> was the first WOD that I got DNF+. I attempted it 3 times, the first was 30mins, the second was 15mins, and the third was around 7mins. I looked through the resources to help me with making the three sections on browsers appear side-by-side as three coloumns. I overlooked where it said, “each 300px”. I first tried to use the float property, but the columns were tight next to each other. I changed the padding for the “row” class, but it still didn’t turn out right. Had I realized that it mentioned to make it 300px each, I probably would’ve finished it sooner. I was stuck and for my second attempt I remembered using the flex property for Lab2 (aligning the product images, row-wrap, etc.) I eventually fixed the columns with the right amount of padding. After watching the screencast, I decided if I decided to stick with my solution (.row and .column) because I felt that it was quicker to execute with less typing such as typing the 3 classes (.left, .right, .center).</p>

<p>All in all, it was a great experience developing the first three WODs with the Athletic Approach. It gave me a clearer picture on what was time-consuming and what could I do to execute my HTML &amp; CSS quicker. I’m glad I didn’t watch the screencast first (although, tempting) because it would’ve hindered growth and progress in my understanding of UI Basics. I’m one to learn through trial and error and with that I recall my mistakes clearly and learn not to make the same mistakes twice. Therefore, I’ll become more efficient as I progress.</p>
