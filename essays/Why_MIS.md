*MIS and ME* 

From my perspective, taking ITM 352 is a good way for me to test the waters and explore a potential career in MIS. 

I dabbled a bit of coding during the good 'ol days of MySpace and that's where I found myself spending long nights customizing and building my very own MySpace page. 

It was there--that memory--that I knew I should try to learn more about basic programming skills which led me to take this class.

The past couple months, I researched more about the Management Information Systems on the Shidler website, the first couple lines threw me off:

“….analyze opportunities for business change and growth using information technologies (IT), to design and develop business solutions that utilize IT, and to manage projects to implement IT-related change.”

 I thought to myself that maybe I didn’t have what it takes to be successful in this major.  But—even though I doubted my potential—for a while, MIS would always lurk in the back of my mind—I was curious. 

“It wouldn’t hurt to try.” 

“You won’t know unless you try.” 

“What do you have to lose?” 

I am curious. 

ITM 352 is just beginning of MIS and me. 

So far, I'm interested.
