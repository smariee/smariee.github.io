From my perspective, taking ITM 352 is a good way for me to test the waters and explore a potential career in MIS. I dabbled a bit of coding during the good 'ol days of MySpace and that's where I found myself spending long nights customizing and building my very own MySpace page. 
<br>  
It was there--that memory--that I knew I should try to learn more about basic programming skills which led me to take this class. The past couple months, I researched more about the Management Information Systems on the Shidler website, the first couple lines threw me off: 
<br>   
<br>
><i>“….analyze opportunities for business change and growth using information technologies (IT), to design and develop business solutions that utilize IT, and to manage projects to implement IT-related change."</i>
<br>  
<br>  
I thought to myself that maybe I didn’t have what it takes to be successful in this major. But—even though I doubted my potential--for a while, MIS would would lurk in the back of my mind—-I was curious. 
<br>   
<br>  
“It wouldn’t hurt to try.” 

“You won’t know unless you try.” 

“What do you have to lose?” 

I am curious. 
<br>
ITM 352 is just beginning of MIS and me.
