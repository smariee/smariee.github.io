## Course Elements and Personal Engagement 

**What did you learn from creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352?**
Creating a publicly accessible professional portfolio for this class was extremely helpful in gaining more knowledge on mark-up html. I love how I was able to personalize it to my own style and that’s what that assignment has done for me. It made it fun and brought that creative side out of me. It has also introduced me to using GitHub and familiarizing with myself how it works. It was interesting how we are able to integrate our resume and create blog entries as part of the home page.  One of the objectives in this assignment was to  be familiarize with popular web application technologies and frameworks (JSON, YAML, Markdown, HTML, CSS, Jekyll, GitHub and GitHuB pages, web servers) and that’s objective has been obtained!

**What did you gain from doing the WODs?**
The WODs were honestly challenging. It was definitely a task that exercised a wide range of tools to building my skills and confidence in this class. It was a season of progress. I haven’t honestly finished some of the WODs, but those that I have completed encouraged me that it takes practice and PRACTICE! I love how Professor Port used the WODs as an “athletic approach to software development”.  I respect that the timing of the WODs allows us to “tangibly measure” our improvement and implement them throughout our labs. 

**Were the quizzes helpful in preparing you for the labs?**
Yes, it was. The quizzes helped in preparing for the labs, especially the readings that were provided and powerpoints as well. It’s like a refresher from the readings and a knowledge check before diving into the labs for that day. 

**What did you learn from doing the labs?**
I learned quite a bit from doing labs such as knowing that being able to do what’s been assigned in each exercise and answering the questions makes you reflect a lot on the thought process of writing that line of code and certain errors. I appreciate how we are able to see the lab objectives so that I’m able to see if I had met it or not. I may not be able to complete some labs, but the ones that I did we’re very helpful. Doing each lab after the other worked built on what was done from the previous labs and I like how it would help me to progress on things that I wasn’t clear on such as doing the HTML forms, I would need to understand the logical requirements for an algorithm. 

**What did you learn from doing the essays?**
The essays helped me to reflect back on the WODs and how I’m able to see the progress I’ve made through trial and error. It gave me a sense of where I needed to work on such as correcting bad habits in implementing code and making sure I’m utilizing what I’ve learned. One example would be hard-coding, I would forget that I’m able to utilize conditional expressions and looping.

**What did you learn from doing Assignment 1 and Assignment 2?**
Doing assignment 1 and 2 tied all the topics we learned for our labs and WODs together. I’m glad that Prof. Port gave us days for workshops so that we could all have an opportunity to raise questions and concerns as we start it. Designing and building an e-store was an experience itself but that was where doing the labs and WODs extremely helped out a lot. I was able to implement what I’ve learned and what it takes to build a good user interface and process user input, validating information with different data types and incorporating user registration and identification.
