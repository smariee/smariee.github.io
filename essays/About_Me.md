*Aloha! You found Sylvia!* 

I am 29 years old. Born and raised in the beautiful island of Oahu, Hawaii. 

I am currently working towards a BBA in MIS and Marketing in Shidler College of Business at University of Hawaii.

I am accompanied by a lovable pet dog named Scruffy, a happy cat named Chasey, and fostering 4 curious kittens: Rocky, Latte (Lala), Fluffy, and Tiny.

I enjoy talking walks with Scruffy and drinking milk tea. Watching Kdramas and Netflix are one of my favorite things to do on my free time. 

Gaining new knowledge about my major piques my curiousity and I hope it stays that way. 

Pleasure meeting you!
