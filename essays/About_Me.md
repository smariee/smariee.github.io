<i>Aloha! My name is Sylvia!</i>
<br>
I am 29 years old. Born and raised in the beautiful island of Oahu, Hawaii. 
<br>
I am a Shidler Undergraduate currently working towards a BBA in MIS.
<br>
Gaining new knowledge about my major piques my curiousity and I hope it stays that way. 
<br>
Pleasure meeting you! ü§ù
