## Invoice1 WOD

This WOD entails using Javascript expressions/variables to generate and display a sales invoice with product data (5 different products).

## Experience

I attempted WOD invoice1 five times. I DNF'd (>40 mins) the first 3 attempts because there were some tasks that took longer than others such as the first part of it. The first part of the WOD involved defining variables for 5 different products broken down into sets (product data, extended prices, sales tax, and grand total). 

Changing the variable names and corresponding values for products 2-5 was time-consuming because I didn't utiltized the find and replace feature of VScode. My goal was to finish it before 20 minutes. It took me about 10-13 minutes to finish that part before moving on to building the HTML table. That means I had only about 7-10 mins to do the rest. 

Building the HTML table was much managable and less time-consuming because I used the first option which was to copy the table source code of Prof. Port's table. I got stuck at adding comments to the product data. At first, I was wondering why the JS comments weren't working (not in green text, but white or brown). Then, I realized that I didn't add the comments withing the script tag for each product. Instead my comments were inside the body acting as an HTML code. 

For my fourth attempt, I finally finished it in 19 minutes. Because I got so used to and familiar with creating and following the tasks, it was easier to follow through and deliver. 
What I had done differently was using the find and replace feature. It took about 6-8 minutes on declaring variables and the rest of the time (until 19 minutes) was used to format my code to make it look clean and organized. 

I could've stopped here.-- I did, I turned in my assignment, YouTube and GitHub link.-- BUT when I played my screencast, I didn't have the microphone on use. Therefore, you couldn't here me narrate what I was doing. So I decided to do it again. 

My fifth attempt was 14 minutes! This was definitely progress! I took out 5 mintues from my previous attempt of 19 mintues. Before starting, I prepped with watching videos about VScode's find and replace feature to see if I can utilize it effectively. Then, I came across a video on keyboard shortcuts:

- Formatting code
- Multi-cursor selection
- copy and paste (one-click)

These shortcuts reduced alot of time! & I'm happy about it :) 
I feel that I should spend more time prepping and researching than usual about what I'll work on before attempting the next WOD.
