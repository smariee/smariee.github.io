##Course Elements and Personal Engagement
**What did you learn from creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352?**
Creating a publicly accessible professional portfolio for this class was extremely helpful in gaining more knowledge on mark-up html. I love how I was able to personalize it to my own style and that’s what that assignment has done for me. It made it fun and brought that creative side out of me. It has also introduced me to using GitHub and familiarizing with myself how it works. It was interesting how we are able to integrate our resume and create blog entries as part of the home page.  One of the objectives in this assignment was to  be familiarize with popular web application technologies and frameworks (JSON, YAML, Markdown, HTML, CSS, Jekyll, GitHub and GitHuB pages, web servers) and that’s objective has been obtained!

**What did you gain from doing the WODs?**
The WODs were honestly challenging. It was definitely a task that exercised a wide range of tools to building my skills and confidence in this class. It was a season of progress. I haven’t honestly finished some of the WODs, but those that I have completed encouraged me that it takes practice and PRACTICE! I love how Professor Port used the WODs as an “athletic approach to software development”.  I respect that the timing of the WODs allows us to “tangibly measure” our improvement and implement them throughout our labs. 

**Were the quizzes helpful in preparing you for the labs?**
Yes, it was. The quizzes helped in preparing for the labs, especially the readings that were provided and powerpoints as well. It’s like a refresher from the readings and a knowledge check before diving into the labs for that day.
